00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.120
Hello and welcome to the
wonderful world of open source.

cafe404b-97e0-4680-82fb-70cdcabeef32-0
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.240
What is open source and why is
it wonderful?

b7ee3d2e-cd2d-4036-8402-9ccc836aaf3b-0
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.815
The short answer to this
question is that open source

b7ee3d2e-cd2d-4036-8402-9ccc836aaf3b-1
00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:15.744
means that the source of the
code is open to the public,

b7ee3d2e-cd2d-4036-8402-9ccc836aaf3b-2
00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.519
meaning that anyone can come and
play in our sandbox.

38a2a8ea-09d7-4db0-a601-afdad55aa703-0
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.575
So projects and computer
languages that are open source

38a2a8ea-09d7-4db0-a601-afdad55aa703-1
00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:24.408
mean that anyone can build on
the work, change it to suit

38a2a8ea-09d7-4db0-a601-afdad55aa703-2
00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:27.534
their needs, or work with others
to make necessary changes they

38a2a8ea-09d7-4db0-a601-afdad55aa703-3
00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.440
might not be able to do by
themselves.

0c7e25e8-00e5-422f-b17e-438c126a0b44-0
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.165
Open source software is also
free, which makes it a great

0c7e25e8-00e5-422f-b17e-438c126a0b44-1
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.484
option for the public sector and
allows us to share our work

0c7e25e8-00e5-422f-b17e-438c126a0b44-2
00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:39.531
broadly to other users like
other state agencies, local

0c7e25e8-00e5-422f-b17e-438c126a0b44-3
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:41.490
governmental units, and the
public.

32dd0fee-7e7c-46c7-ab71-3f17a04ca545-0
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.268
This differs vastly from the
world of proprietary software,

32dd0fee-7e7c-46c7-ab71-3f17a04ca545-1
00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:48.487
where licensing fees, software
costs, or delayed updates or

32dd0fee-7e7c-46c7-ab71-3f17a04ca545-2
00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:51.331
deployments can make it
difficult to share your work

32dd0fee-7e7c-46c7-ab71-3f17a04ca545-3
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:53.369
outside or even within your own
team.

21e8a9f5-e0ba-4ec0-9b11-8f87a33fa799-0
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.070
The open source programming
language we're going to be

21e8a9f5-e0ba-4ec0-9b11-8f87a33fa799-1
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.485
learning about in these sessions
is a language called RR is a

21e8a9f5-e0ba-4ec0-9b11-8f87a33fa799-2
00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.515
language that was originally
developed for statistical

21e8a9f5-e0ba-4ec0-9b11-8f87a33fa799-3
00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:07.160
analysis, data visualization,
and manipulation.

b3275811-ae81-460f-b01c-3c02a32b4ceb-0
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.196
Since it started to gain
popularity, it's also grown in

b3275811-ae81-460f-b01c-3c02a32b4ceb-1
00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.040
functionality and can do more
than ever before.

678cb00c-a94a-4a57-9f35-d0e1182d11e0-0
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.511
The R community is ever growing
and now worldwide and that means

678cb00c-a94a-4a57-9f35-d0e1182d11e0-1
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.807
that the community is continuing
to build new tools, features and

678cb00c-a94a-4a57-9f35-d0e1182d11e0-2
00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:24.760
applications for the language.

4afaebc8-34eb-497e-9727-05ed7da8bc7a-0
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.490
There's also an active community
at the state of Minnesota.

7a4520bc-847e-416a-bff5-05d909c1c446-0
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.492
We have a cross agency team that
represents 7 different agencies

7a4520bc-847e-416a-bff5-05d909c1c446-1
00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.050
with over 150 members.

206be17c-5f44-430b-b31e-50467bf0377b-0
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.763
We meet weekly on our tidy
Tuesdays to talk about problems,

206be17c-5f44-430b-b31e-50467bf0377b-1
00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:41.930
present fantastic solutions, and
share tips and tricks.

1c9002a8-a256-4653-b58d-da25cbb27fca-0
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.844
It started as a small group of
dedicated practitioners and it's

1c9002a8-a256-4653-b58d-da25cbb27fca-1
00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:46.810
continues to grow.

d2b95772-4ec6-41a6-ae79-4f91f5052537-0
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.463
We use R to do many different
things, mainly data related and

d2b95772-4ec6-41a6-ae79-4f91f5052537-1
00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:57.082
those include connecting to
databases, reading and data from

d2b95772-4ec6-41a6-ae79-4f91f5052537-2
00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:01.397
all kinds of formats including
CSV, excel, Jason and the

d2b95772-4ec6-41a6-ae79-4f91f5052537-3
00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:05.712
occasionally weird delimited
file like TSVS which is tab

d2b95772-4ec6-41a6-ae79-4f91f5052537-4
00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:06.999
separated values.

62f688bd-79ed-4014-a545-4c4bddb1d129-0
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.120
Who thought of that?

0081890f-1025-4e81-9bb1-802648ed06ac-0
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.850
We use R to document our work
and share our methods with

0081890f-1025-4e81-9bb1-802648ed06ac-1
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.240
others.

057e3e0b-33f3-41d7-ad38-272a91abf57e-0
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.703
We can use R to create reports,
dashboards, and presentations

057e3e0b-33f3-41d7-ad38-272a91abf57e-1
00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.440
just like this one that are easy
to update and automate.

d99d7209-432f-4269-9abe-55a80bc7a782-0
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.716
The major benefit to solving our
problems in R is that our work

d99d7209-432f-4269-9abe-55a80bc7a782-1
00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:29.040
becomes reproducible and
shareable, meaning others can

d99d7209-432f-4269-9abe-55a80bc7a782-2
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.846
take our work and get the same
solutions just by running our R

d99d7209-432f-4269-9abe-55a80bc7a782-3
00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:33.330
scripts.

bef5d37d-3873-4afe-81d4-5f159a1d3d3e-0
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650
That's because an R script is
like a recipe for cookies.

82662a9c-2526-43f7-9b90-f10866a1f19e-0
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.700
It follows a top to bottom, step
by step process that others can

82662a9c-2526-43f7-9b90-f10866a1f19e-1
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.370
read and follow over and over
again.

fc358f3a-a79a-4581-b759-5e29dd973633-0
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.406
Oh no, if this scenario looks
familiar to you, that's

fc358f3a-a79a-4581-b759-5e29dd973633-1
00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:53.100
something R can help us with as
well.

5966c6b2-80aa-4a33-9478-952fa9d18d3b-0
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.576
Using R we can write a procedure
to clean, corral and fancy up

5966c6b2-80aa-4a33-9478-952fa9d18d3b-1
00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:01.366
data for a report and then
automate sending that data via

5966c6b2-80aa-4a33-9478-952fa9d18d3b-2
00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.980
e-mail in one easy to update
procedure.

10275531-951e-43e7-aa33-a454b82d040c-0
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.088
This can reduce time errors and
for you up to tackle those

10275531-951e-43e7-aa33-a454b82d040c-1
00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.420
really hard projects that no one
has had time to do.

8c146ad2-71b5-41aa-864f-e478d85b9b5e-0
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.260
Because we're so busy doing the
everyday tasks.

3250676e-7f9b-4f62-985a-5ed95e0070c8-0
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.302
We've talked about a bunch of
things that make R awesome, but

3250676e-7f9b-4f62-985a-5ed95e0070c8-1
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:22.910
there's lots of really cool
tools out there.

fc1f349a-1949-463e-91ce-fbbd3d4101d3-0
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.910
So what makes R stand out from
the crowd?

d58e6f96-39ce-417e-958c-5c579d13cbe6-0
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.110
R versus Excel.

8de9b1e2-c128-4ace-9c95-385a2cccfe35-0
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.652
R can handle much larger data
sets, and I mean really large

8de9b1e2-c128-4ace-9c95-385a2cccfe35-1
00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.550
data sets, and it won't take
forever either.

ffefb22e-c102-4f9d-beb0-cc383459ae9a-0
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.030
R is more flexible than Excel.

b4abb3df-b155-4331-87e6-786017844ac2-0
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.103
It can take many different data
types, including pulling data

b4abb3df-b155-4331-87e6-786017844ac2-1
00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:43.310
directly from a database.

c8dca983-dd6b-46cd-a9c6-43c837ceb6d6-0
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.160
R analysis are more
reproducible.

dc19713e-7721-4af5-853e-1ae227acf22f-0
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.531
It can be extremely hard to
figure out how someone did an

dc19713e-7721-4af5-853e-1ae227acf22f-1
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:51.400
analysis in Excel, if not
impossible.

1e731dba-6e25-4c2b-9df0-cb91d6c45507-0
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.948
In R you're provided with a step
by step procedure for how

1e731dba-6e25-4c2b-9df0-cb91d6c45507-1
00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:56.040
someone did the work.

c219a224-7a35-4a14-9d32-d35e13665117-0
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.855
Excel is more widely used, but
that doesn't mean it's always

c219a224-7a35-4a14-9d32-d35e13665117-1
00:03:59.855 --> 00:04:01.120
the right tool for the job.

885d2733-dfdc-457c-b0e7-aea9c3d434ac-0
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.818
Think of the if all you have is
a hammer analogy, R versus

885d2733-dfdc-457c-b0e7-aea9c3d434ac-1
00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:08.640
Tableau.

4613c0aa-e6e1-44a7-9764-07ba765002cd-0
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620
Tableau is primarily a data
visualization software.

39e368a9-74f2-49fd-b930-6c815548fb02-0
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.043
Tableau does not have a strong
analysis component and might not

39e368a9-74f2-49fd-b930-6c815548fb02-1
00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:18.783
be able to do the kinds of
statistical analysis you might

39e368a9-74f2-49fd-b930-6c815548fb02-2
00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:19.020
need.

61c95e51-5152-44db-a86f-e6b002aaf31f-0
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.945
Our shiny is more flexible and
can do more on the flight

61c95e51-5152-44db-a86f-e6b002aaf31f-1
00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.420
calculations and is very user
input driven.

b19b4f88-8aa7-4a46-8d39-2ab26638b608-0
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.470
Tableau's drag and drop
interface makes it faster and

b19b4f88-8aa7-4a46-8d39-2ab26638b608-1
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.761
easier for creating simple
visualizations, but is not

b19b4f88-8aa7-4a46-8d39-2ab26638b608-2
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:33.980
easily reproducible.

000d649a-94f0-4a6c-bb60-c0a25bc3937d-0
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.369
R is 100% text based so you can
track changes over time

000d649a-94f0-4a6c-bb60-c0a25bc3937d-1
00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.290
#versioncontrol R versus SQL.

b0c51208-b228-44f9-906d-16f5e6f311ae-0
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.450
SQL is the language of
databases.

c9e27a60-a866-4e07-abd3-445c88ab5290-0
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.487
It's easy to learn if you know
you'll be working with databases

c9e27a60-a866-4e07-abd3-445c88ab5290-1
00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.450
a lot, but you might not be and
then it's really not much use if

c9e27a60-a866-4e07-abd3-445c88ab5290-2
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.730
all you're dealing with is flat
files or exports.

142697dd-971c-47df-a8b8-f2fc4bdc734c-0
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.951
SQL queries are sent to a
database server and processed

142697dd-971c-47df-a8b8-f2fc4bdc734c-1
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.890
then before returning the data.

00b1aaa4-b677-4b0b-abac-23d2d45ec3a1-0
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.571
This can take a lot of time
depending on the size of the

00b1aaa4-b677-4b0b-abac-23d2d45ec3a1-1
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.869
query and there are more time

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.961
So what we're really saying is
that you don't even need to know

76dcbdf6-8757-4809-9b5b-1ff631cd578e-1
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:20.900
SQL if you know R which is
pretty cool.

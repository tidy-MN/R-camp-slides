

The Wookies want our help. BB8 just received new data from the wookies suggesting there was a large magnetic storm just before `Site 1` burned down on Endor. Sounds like we're going to be __STORM CHASERS__!  _Mission accepted._

<br>

### Get the dataset {-}

While we're relaxing and flying to Endor let's get set up with the new data.

<div class="tip">

### Endor setup {-}

1. Download the data.
    - <a href="https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv"><span class="btn_code_blue" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 12px;"> __DOWNLOAD__  </span></a> -  Get the Endor monitoring data
1. Create a new folder called `data` in your project folder.
1. Move the downloaded Endor file to there.
1. Create a new R script called `endor.R`

<br>

Now we can read in the data from the data folder with our favorite `read_csv` function.

```{r, endor-air-read, eval=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

air_endor <- read_csv("data/air_endor.csv")

names(air_endor)

# Clean the column names
air_endor <- clean_names(air_endor)

names(air_endor)
```

```{r, endor-air-read2, echo=F, message=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

air_endor <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv")

air_endor <- clean_names(air_endor)

names(air_endor)
```
</div>

<br>

<div class="note">

### Note {-}

When your project is open, RStudio sets the working directory to your project folder. When reading files from a folder outside of your project, you'll need to use the full file path location.

For example, for a file on the __X-drive__: `X://Programs/Air_Quality/Ozone_data.csv`
<br>

</div>


## Welcome to Endor! {-}

<br>

__Let's get to know the Endor data.__

Remember the ways?

__Hint:__ `summary()`, `glimpse()`, `nrow()`, `distinct()`


<br>


```{r, endor-air2}
glimpse(air_endor)
```

<br>
```{r, dist}
distinct(air_endor, analyte)
```
<br>

__Woah! That's definitely more analytes than we need.__ 

We only want to know about `magnetic_field` data. Let's filter down to that analyte.

<br>
```{r, endor-air-filter}
mag_endor <- filter(air_endor, analyte == "magnetic_field")
```

__Boom!__ How many rows are left now?

<br>


>
> Ok. According to the request we received, the Resistance is only interested in observations from year __`2017`__. 
> So let's filter the data down to only dates for that year.
>
> __How do we filter on the date column?__
>

<br>

<div class="well">
With time series data it's helpful for R to know which columns are __dates__. Dates come in many formats and the standard format in R is `2019-01-15`, also referred to as _Year-Month-Day_ format. We use the __`lubridate`__ package to help format our dates.
</div>


# <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dates
<hr>

### Enter the `lubridate` package. {-}

![](../images/lubridate.png){style="width: 21%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}


<br>

It's about time! Lubridate makes working with dates much easier.

We can find how much time has elapsed, add or subtract days, and find seasonal and day of the week averages.

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<br>


### Install `lubridate` {-}

**Run:** 
```{r, eval=F}  
install.packages("lubridate")
```

<br>

### Convert text to a `DATE` {-}

| Function    |  Order of date elements                                 |
|----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|

|`dmy()  `    | Day-Month-Year (Euro dates) :: `18-05-2019` or `18/05/2019`    |
|`ymd()  `    | Year-Month-Day (science dates) :: `2019-05-18` or `2019/05/18` |

### Get date parts {-}

|`week()`    | Week of the year  |
|`day()`     | Day of the month  |
|`wday()`    | Day of the week as _1,2,3_; For _Sun, Mon, Tue_ use `label=TRUE` |
| _- Time -_   |            |

#### Real world examples {-}

Does your date column look like one of these? Here's the `lubridate` function to tell R that the column is a date.


| Format |  Function to use         |   
|--------|:-------------------------|  
| "05/18/2019" | `mdy(date_column)  ` |  
| "May 18, 2019" | `mdy(date_column)  `       |
| "05/18/2019 8:00 CDT" | `mdy_hm(date_column, tz = "US/Central")  `|
| "05/18/2019 11:05:32 PDT" | `mdy_hms(date_column, tz = "US/Pacific")  `|

<br>

__European dates__

| Format |  Function to use         |   
|--------|:-------------------------| 
| "30.05.2019" | `dmy(date_column) `  |
| "30-05-2019" | `dmy(date_column) `  |
| "30/05/2019" | `dmy(date_column) `  |

<br>

__All number dates__

| Format |  Function to use         |   
|--------|:-------------------------| 
| "20190518" | `ymd(sample_date) `  |

## Small problem {-}

__Oh no!__ BB8 got locked out of the system! You need the passcode before you can unlock the data. 

There's a cryptic note on the pad next to you... _"Moonie's birthday"._ Could that be the hint to the passcode?

We need to determine when Moonie's birthday is...time to get out our detective hats.

You ask the lead engineer: 

__So when is Moonie's birthday?__

> _"I think it's on a Tuesday this year"_

__Any more helpful clues? Anything?__

> _"Hmmm... Let's see, I think it was around the 22nd week of the year. Yep. That's it."_

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

After some more interviews you now have a list of dates that could be Marty's birthday. Find the date that occurred on the Tuesday of the 22nd week of the year.

```{r lubridate-puzzle, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
library(lubridate)

date1 <- "7/2/2019"

date2 <- "28/05/2019"

date3 <- "June 4th, 2019"
```


__Step 1:__ Use `mdy(date)` or `dmy(date)` to convert the dates to the universal date format.

week(date1)

#2
date2 <- dmy("28/05/2019")
wday(date2, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
week(date2)

#3
date3 <- mdy("June 4th, 2019")
wday(date3, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
week(date3)

## Back on Endor! {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Let's use the `mdy()` function to turn the `start_run_date` column into a nicely formatted date.

```{r endor-air-mutate, message=F}
library(lubridate)

mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, date = mdy(start_run_date),
                               year = year(date))
```
<br>

> Ok, back to work. 
>
> Let's filter to only the rows where the __`year`__ equals __`2017`__.
>

<br>
```{r endor-air-filter-year}
mag_endor <- filter(mag_endor, year == 2017)
```


## Time series {-}
```{r endor-time, message=F}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mag_endor, aes(x = date, y = result)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "tomato") +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.5)  # alpha changes transparency

```

Looks like the measurements definitely picked up a signal towards the end of the year.

<br>

<div class="data">
### Mystery solved! {-}

Aha! There really was a spike in the magnetic field in November. Hopefully, the _Resistance_ will reward us handsomely for this information.

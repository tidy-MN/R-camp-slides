
### The Ewoks need our help. There's porgs **EVERYWHERE!** {-}

<img src="../images/porgs_bb8_2.jpg" style="margin-top: -12px; width: 70%;">


Porgs have been spreading across the galaxy; likely by hitching rides on unsuspecting ships. They're so cute people hate to say it, but they are starting to become a nuisance. 

To get a grasp on the population explosion the Ewoks are launching a porg survey. And they need your **help**.

<br>

It's about time! Lubridate makes working with dates much easier.

We can find how much time has elapsed, add or subtract days, and find seasonal and day of the week averages. The package is included in the `tidyverse` bundle of packages, so it's already installed!

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

**View the date cheatsheet [HERE](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf)**. 

It's a great reference when you need to manipulate dates or timezones in your data.

### Survey objective {-}

<div class="well">

- The Ewoks have asked you help organize their Porg survey.
- In 2023, they would like to perform a porg count once a week from May to October.
- They have enough volunteers to run the survey at two locations
    - `Bright Tree` and `Fern Gully`
    
</div>

<br>

Let's generate the full list of dates during this time span using the sequence function: ` seq()`

#### Run the code below to create a list of dates for the survey. {-}
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

start_date <- ymd("2023-05-01")

end_date   <- ymd("2023-10-31")

# Sequence from start to end, counting by 1 day intervals
survey_dates <- seq(from = start_date, 
                    to = end_date, 
                    by = "day")
```

<br>

### How many days will the survey run? {-}


<details>
<summary class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> *184 days*

</details>

<br>

### Let's put the dates in a dataframe {-}

> You can create a dataframe with the functions `data.frame()` or `tibble()`.


### Here's a reminder {-}
```{r}
survey <- data.frame(count_date = survey_dates)

# or

survey <- tibble(count_date = survey_dates)

head(survey)
```


### Yes! {-}


## 1. Scheduling weekdays {-}

<img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/calendar-1562-518053.png" align=right />

Ewoks are very busy. They only have one day per week when they can volunteer. 

Here is the weekday when volunteers are available at each location:

- Bright Tree: ` Thursdays`
- Fern Gully: ` Fridays`

<br>

We can use the `seq.Date()` function and the option to step `by = "week"` to
generate the survey dates for each site. But we need to know which day to start from.


> #### When is the first Thursday in May of 2023? {-}


<br>

For that, we can use the `wday()`, the "weekday" function.

```{r, eval=T}
# wday tells you the day of week (Sun, Mon, etc..) for a specific date
wday(ymd('2023-05-01'), label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

<br>

So the `1st` of May will be a Monday. 
That means.... **May the 4th** will be a Thursday. Perfect! That's my favorite day.


## Mutate to the rescue {-}

We really don't want to check every date one by one do we? 

Let's add a new `week_day` column to our survey table that checks ALL the dates ALL at once. To add a new column we call our friend `mutate()`.


Complete the code below to add a `week_day` column.
```{r, eval=F}

survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = wday( ________ , label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
```


```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
library(knitr)

survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = wday(count_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
```

<br>

## `filter()` week days {-}

With **filter** we can pick out only the days of the week that we want. 

Split the schedule in two by filtering the survey to only the week day needed at each site: 

- ` Thursday` for Bright Tree
- ` Friday` for Fern Gully

<br>

```{r, eval=F}
bright_dates <- filter(survey, week_day ==  ________ )

fern_dates   <- filter(survey, week_day ==  ________ )
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
bright_dates <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Thursday" )

fern_dates   <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Friday" )
```

</details>


<br>


**How many survey dates are at each site?**

> *Hint: It's less than 50.*


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> **26 survey days**

</details>

<br>


## 2. Particular date formats {-}

<img align="left" src="../images/dwight.png" style="margin-right: 14px;">

Oh no! Each survey site has a very-very particular **Assistant to the Regional Manager**. And they are demanding a very **specific** date format for their work schedules. 

<br>

Before you send off the survey dates, you'll need to adjust the dates to match the requested formats below. 

**Preferred date formats**

- Bright Tree: ` 5-11-2023`
- Fern Gully: ` May 12, 2023`

<br>

Use `format(count_date, ...)` and the date expressions below to format the schedule for each region accordingly. 

> For example: `format(count_date, "%b, %Y")` prints the date as `Aug, 2023`.
> 
> - `%b`  stands for 3-letter month abbreviation 
> - `%Y%` stands for the full 4 digit year


### Date parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%Y`          | Year (4 digit)                    | 2023     |
| `%y`          | Year (2 digit)                    | 21       |
| `%B`          | Month (full name)                 | December |
| `%b`          | Month (abbreviated)               | Dec      |
| `%m`          | Month (decimal number)            | 12       |
| `%d`          | Day of the month (decimal number) | 30       |


### Time parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%H`          | Hour                              | 8        |
| `%M`          | Minute                            | 13       |
| `%S`          | Second                            | 35       |


<br>

Use `mutate()` to update the **week_day** column in both site schedules.

**Here's a start**

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Set date format to 5-11-2023
bright_dates <- mutate(bright_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, _______  ))

# Set date format to May 12, 2023
fern_dates <- mutate(fern_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, _______ ))
```


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
# Set date format to 5-11-2023
bright_dates <- mutate(bright_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, "%m-%d-%Y"))

# Set date format to May 12, 2023
fern_dates <- mutate(fern_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, "%b %d, %Y"))
```

</details>

### How'd we do? {-}

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Bright Tree schedule
head(bright_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(bright_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Fern Gully schedule
head(fern_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(fern_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```


<br>

**Congrats\!**

Your fine-tuned schedules worked perfectly. 

Now letâ€™s jump ahead and take a look at the survey results.


## 3. Results {-}

![](../images/porgs_lifecycle.jpg){width=80%}


### Load the porg survey results. {-}

```{r, eval=F}
porgs <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/2023_porg_survey_results.csv")   
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
porgs <- read_csv("../../../content/data/2023_porg_survey_results.csv")   
```


<br>

*Explore a bit.* 

> Are there missing values?

<br>

### A missing site {-}

It looks like we have a slight missing data problem.

Thereâ€™s a data point in the results that wasnâ€™t labeled with the site
location. We do know the date however. 

On `2023-06-30` there were a whopping 7 porgs counted - but we just donâ€™t know where.

<br>

**Can you determine the site based on the date of the porg count?**

```{r}
mystery_site_date <- "2023-06-30"
```

> *Hint: What weekday is this?*
>
> Try the `wday(date)` function.

<br>


**Good sleuthing data droid.**

We'll learn how to update the site value later today, but right now we're in a hurry, so let's remove the row using filter.

Use `filter()` to keep only the rows in the porgs data where `site` is **NOT** *NA* (missing).

```{r, eval=T}
porgs <- filter(porgs, !is.na(site))  
```

<br>


## 4. The best time for porgs {-}

> ### What is the best month to see porgs? {-}

**First, add a `month` column to the data with the function `month()` and the column `count_date`.**

```{r, eval=T}
porgs <- mutate(porgs, month = month(count_date))
```

<br>

**Next, use `ggplot()` and `geom_col()` to plot the porg sightings by month.**

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = month, y = ______ , fill = site)) +
    geom_col()
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = month, y = porg_count, fill = site)) +
    geom_col()
```

</details>

<br>

> Why might June be the lowest month?
>
> *Hint:* Fern Gully


## 5. Time series: All the data {-}

Plot all the data with `geom_point()`. Put `count_date` on the x-axis, and the `porg_count` on the y-axis. Set the color to match the `site` column.

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = _______, y = ______ , color = _____ )) +
    geom_point(size = 5)
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) 
```

</details>


<br>

Oof! That's a busy plot. Try adding `+ facet_wrap("site")` to the end. 
What happens?

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap("site")   #<<
```

<br>

Try adding `+ geom_line()`. 

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ site) +
  geom_line()                #<<
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ site) +
  geom_line()
```

</details>

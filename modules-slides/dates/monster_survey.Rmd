### Monsters **EVERYWHERE!** {-}

<img src="../images/gganimate_allison_horst.png" alt="Cartoon of a bunch of monsters watching data points of varing color and shape fly across a screen like fireworks. Several monsters are lighting the data off like fireworks." style="margin-top: -12px; width: 70%;">

It seemed like a good idea to bring those helpful monsters along, and they're so cute. People hate to say it, but they are starting to become a real nuisance. 

To get a grasp on the population explosion of monsters our research vessel is launching a full-scale monster survey. And they need our **help**.


# <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dates with `lubridate` 
<hr>

### The `lubridate` package. {-}

![](../images/lubridate.png){style="width: 21%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}

<br>

It's about time! Lubridate makes working with dates much easier.

We can find how much time has elapsed, add or subtract days, and find season and day of the week averages. The package is included in the `tidyverse` bundle of packages, so it's already installed!

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

**View the date cheatsheet [HERE](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf)**. 

It's a great reference when you need to manipulate dates or timezones in your data.

### Survey objective {-}

<div class="well">

- Organize the monster survey schedule.
- Starting May 2024, they would like to schedule a monster count once a week until October.
- They have enough volunteers to run the survey on two islands
    - `Dream` and `Biscoe`
    
</div>

<br>

Let's generate the full list of dates during this time span with the sequence function: ` seq()`

#### Run the code below to create a list of dates for the survey. {-}
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

start_date <- ymd("2024-05-01")

end_date   <- ymd("2024-10-31")

# Sequence from start to end, counting by a 1 day interval
survey_dates <- seq(from = start_date, 
                    to = end_date, 
                    by = "day")
```

<br>

### How many days will the survey run? {-}

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> *184 days*

</details>

<br>

### Let's put the dates in a dataframe {-}

> You can create a dataframe with the functions `data.frame()` or `tibble()`.


### Here's a reminder {-}
```{r}
survey <- data.frame(count_date = survey_dates)

# or

survey <- tibble(count_date = survey_dates)

head(survey)
```

<br>


## 1. Scheduling weekdays {-}

<img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/calendar-1562-518053.png" align=right />

Scientists on our boat are busy people. They only have one day per week when they can volunteer. 

Here is the weekday when volunteers are available for each island:

- Dream: ` Saturdays`
- Biscoe: ` Tuesdays`

<br>


> ### When is the first Saturday in May of 2024? {-}

<br>

For that, we can use the `wday()` (the "weekday") function.

> Try changing some of the TRUE/FALSE values to see what the arguments are doing.

```{r, eval=T}
new_date <- ymd('2024-05-01')

# wday tells you the day of week (Sun, Mon, etc..) for a specific date
wday(new_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

<br>

So the `1st` of May will be a Wednesday. 
That means....**May the 4th** will be on Saturday. Perfect! That's my favorite day.


## Mutate to the rescue {-}

We really don't want to check every date one by one do we? 

Let's add a new `week_day` column to our survey table that checks ALL the dates ALL at once. To add a new column we call on `mutate()`.


Complete the code below to add a `week_day` column to our *survey_dates* table.

```{r, eval=F}
survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = ________ )
```

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>

<br>

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
library(knitr)

survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = wday(count_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
```

</details>

<br>


## `filter()` week days {-}

With **filter** we can pick out the days of the week that we want. 

Split the schedule in two by filtering the survey to only the week day needed at each island: 

- ` Saturday` for Dream
- ` Tuesday` for Biscoe

<br>

```{r, eval=F}
dream_dates <- filter(survey,  ______ ==  ________ )

biscoe_dates <- filter(survey, ______ ==  ________ )
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
<br>

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
dream_dates <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Thursday" )

biscoe_dates   <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Friday" )
```

</details>


<br>


**How many survey dates are at each island?**

> *Hint: It's less than 50.*


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> **26 survey days**

</details>

<br>


## 2. Custom date formats {-}

Oh no! Each survey island has been assigned a very-very particular **Assistant to the Regional Manager**. And they are demanding a very **specific** date format be used for their work schedules. 

<br>

Before you send off the survey dates, you'll need to adjust the dates to match the requested formats below. 

**Preferred date formats**

- Dream: ` 05-18-2024`
- Biscoe: ` May 18, 2024`

<br>

Use `format(count_date, ...)` and the date expressions below to format the schedule for each region accordingly. 

> For example: `format(count_date, "%b, %Y")` prints the date as `May, 2024`.
> 
> - `%b`  stands for 3-letter month abbreviation 
> - `%Y%` stands for the full 4 digit year


### Date parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%Y`          | Year (4 digit)                    | 2023     |
| `%y`          | Year (2 digit)                    | 21       |
| `%B`          | Month (full name)                 | December |
| `%b`          | Month (abbreviated)               | Dec      |
| `%m`          | Month (decimal number)            | 12       |
| `%d`          | Day of the month (decimal number) | 30       |


### Time parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%H`          | Hour                              | 8        |
| `%M`          | Minute                            | 13       |
| `%S`          | Second                            | 35       |


<br>

Use `mutate()` to update the **week_day** column for both island schedules.

**Here's a start**

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Set date format to 05-18-2024
dream_dates <- mutate(dream_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, _______  ))

# Set date format to May 18, 2024
biscoe_dates <- mutate(biscoe_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, _______ ))
```


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
# Set date format to 05-18-2024
dream_dates <- mutate(dream_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, "%m-%d-%Y"))

# Set date format to May 07, 2024
biscoe_dates <- mutate(biscoe_dates, pretty_date = format(count_date, "%b %d, %Y"))
```

</details>

### How'd we do? {-}

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Dream Tree schedule
head(dream_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(dream_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Biscoe schedule
head(biscoe_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(biscoe_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```


<br>

**Congrats\!**

Your fine-tuned schedules worked perfectly. 

Now letâ€™s jump ahead and take a look at the survey results.


## 3. Results {-}

### Load the monster survey results. {-}

```{r, eval=T}
monsters <- read_csv("https://github.com/tidy-MN/R-camp-slides/raw/main/2024_monster_survey.csv")   
```


<br>

*Explore a bit.* 

> Are there any missing values?

<br>

### A missing island {-}

It looks like we have a slight missing data problem.

Thereâ€™s a data point in the results that wasnâ€™t labeled with the island
location. We do know the date however. 

On `2024-06-25` there were a whopping 7 monsters counted - but we just donâ€™t know where.

<br>

**Can you determine the island based on the date of the monster count?**

```{r}
mystery_island_date <- "2024-06-25"
```

> *Hint: What weekday is this?*
>
> Try the `wday(date)` function.

<br>


**Good sleuthing baking bot.**

Right now we're in a bit of a hurry, so let's remove the row using filter.

Use `filter()` to keep only the rows in the survey data where `island` is **NOT** *NA* (missing).

```{r, eval=T}
monsters <- filter(monsters, !is.na(island))  
```

<br>


## 4. The best time for monsters {-}

> ### What is the best month to see monsters? {-}

**First, add a `month` column to the data with the function `month()` and the column `count_date`.**

```{r, eval=T}
monsters <- mutate(monsters, month = month(count_date))
```

<br>

**Next, use `ggplot()` and `geom_col()` to plot the monster sightings by month.**

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = month, y = ______ , fill = island)) +
    geom_col()
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = month, y = monster_count, fill = island)) +
    geom_col()
```

</details>

<br>

> Why might June be the lowest month?
>
> **Hint:** *When was that data we dropped?*


## 5. Time series: All the data {-}

Plot all the data with `geom_point()`. Put `count_date` on the x-axis, and the `monster_count` on the y-axis. Set the color to match the `island` column.

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = _______, y = ______ , color = _____ )) +
    geom_point(size = 5)
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = count_date, y = monster_count, color = island)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) 
```

</details>


<br>

Oof! That's a busy plot. Try adding `+ facet_wrap("island")` to the end. 
What happens?

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = count_date, y = monster_count, color = island)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap("island")   #<<
```

<br>

Try adding `+ geom_line()`. 

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = count_date, y = monster_count, color = island)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ island) +
  geom_line()                #<<
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(monsters, aes(x = count_date, y = monster_count, color = island)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ island) +
  geom_line()
```

</details>

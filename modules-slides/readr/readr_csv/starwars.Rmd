
To help find the junk we need for our ship we're going to conduct a scrap audit. The first step of a good audit is reading in data determine where all the scrap is coming from. 

Here's a small dataset showing the scrap economy on Jakku. It was salvaged from a crash site, but the transfer was incomplete.

```{r ex-data1, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(knitr)

options(scipen = 999)

scrap <- data.frame(origin      = c("Outskirts", "Niima Outpost", "Cratertown", "Tro----"), 
                    destination = c("Raiders", "Trade caravan", "Plutt", "Ta----"), 
                    item        = c("Bulkhead", "Hull panels", "Hyperdrives", "So---*"), 
                    amount      = c(332, 1120, 45, 1), 
                    price_d     = c("300", "286", "45", "10----"))

kable(scrap)
```


This looks like it could be useful. Now, if only we had some more data to work with...

## CSV to the rescue {-}

The main data format used in R is the __CSV__ _(comma-separated values)_. A __CSV__ is a simple text file that can be opened in R and most other data tools, including Excel. It looks squished together as plain text, but that's okay! When opened in R, the text becomes a familiar looking table with columns and rows. 

Before we launch ahead, let's add a _package_ to R that will help us read __CSV__ files.

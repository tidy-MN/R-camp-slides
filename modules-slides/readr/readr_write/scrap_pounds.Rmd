
We are ready to save our data. You can save data to a file with a handy function from the  **`readr`** package. Let's use the function `write_csv()` to save our new table with the tons converted to pounds to a CSV file named *"scrap_in_pounds"*.


```{r write-csv1, eval=T}
# Save data as a CSV file 
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

> Where did R save the file? 
>
> _Hint:_ You can look in the lower right `[Files]` tab.

Let's create a new `results/` folder to keep our processed data separate from any raw data we receive. Now we can add `results/` to our file path in `write_csv()` to tell R to put the file in that folder.

```{r write-csv2, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file to results folder
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "results/scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

# .bigger[How is .bigger[[.teal[R]]] different?]

class: inverse

# **.bigger[.teal[R]] vs. Excel**

- R can handle much larger data sets
- R is more flexible than Excel
- R analyses are more reproducible
- Excel is more widely used

# **.bigger[.teal[R]] vs. Tableau**

- Tableau is primarily a data visualization software. 
    - R Shiny is more flexible.
- Tableau's drag-and-drop interface makes it faster and easier for creating simple visualizations, but is not easily reproducible.
    - R is 100% text-based so you can track changes over time. `#VersionControl`

# **.bigger[.teal[R]] vs. SQL**

- SQL is the language of databases.
- SQL queries are sent to a database server and processed there before returning the data.  
- R can run SQL queries to pull data from databases / data lakes.
- R has the `dbplyr` package which converts R to an SQL query.
- R can read data from almost anywhere (databases, flat files, web pages)

class: inverse

# **.bigger[.teal[R]] vs. Python**

- Python is a general-purpose programming language popular for doing internet things.
    - R is more specifically focused on visualizations and statistical analysis.  
- Compared to python's `pandas`, R's Tidyverse is more intuitive and easier to use.
- Historically Python has been used with GIS software like ArcGIS, but spatial analysis with R has been growing.

class: inverse

# **.bigger[.teal[R]] vs. SAS**

- R is open-source, while SAS requires a license.
- Anyone can create and add updates to R packages at anytime.
- New features for SAS only become available when the SAS team makes it so.

Let's launch ourselves into the unknown and use R to make a `Word Cloud`. With a little copy and pasting we can make a cool image out of everyone's name in the class. Consider this an RStudio warm-up.

We're going to make this graphic, and you're going to make your name really <span style="font-size: 26px;"> __BIG__ </span>.


### INSTRUCTIONS {-}

1. Open R Studio

<br>

2. Copy the code below into your script in RStudio. Start with the line `install.packages` and end with the line `color = 'random-dark')`.

```{r wordcloud, eval=F}
install.packages(c("wordcloud2", "dplyr"))
library(wordcloud2)
library(dplyr)

class <- c("Kari"     = 8, 
           "Nathan"   = 8, 
           "Eric"     = 8, 
           "Carma"    = 9, 
           "Sarah"    = 8, 
           "Phil"     = 9, 
           "Brandy"   = 9, 
           "Kayla"    = 8, 
           "Shane"    = 9, 
           "Vallen"   = 8, 
           "Nick"     = 9,
           "Tyler"    = 9,
           "R"        = 26, 
           "2019"     = 20,
           "Fond du Lac" = 16,
           "Porgs!"    = 14,
           "Endor"     = 10,
           "Jakku"     = 10,
           "BB8"       = 12,
           "Rey"       = 8,
           "Melinda"   = 8, 
           "Kristie"   = 8, 
           "Joy"       = 8, 
           "Dorian"    = 8)

# Add 20 random Star Wars names as small text, size = 4
class <- c(class, rep(4, 20))

names(class)[(length(class)-19):length(class)] <- sample_n(starwars, 20)$name      

# Plot the Word Cloud
wordcloud2(data.frame(word = names(class), freq = class), 
           size  = 1, 
           color = 'random-dark')

```

<br>

3. In R Studio click on __File > New File > R Script__. You will see a code editor window open. 

![](../images/new_script_file.png){style="width: 65%; margin-bottom: 18px;"}

4. Paste the copied code into the upper left hand window. This is your code editor.  
5. Highlight all of the code and hit `CTRL + ENTER`.

> You should see a Word Cloud pop up in the lower right of RStudio.

6. Now try increasing the number next to your name.  
7. Run the code again.
8. Make your name even __BIGGER!__

Let's launch ourselves into the unknown and use R to make a `Word Cloud`. With a little copy-pasting we can make a fun image out of everyone's name in the class. 

Since you're such a big deal, we can also help you make your name really <span style="font-size: 26px;"> __BIG__ </span>.

<h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>

1. Open R Studio

2. Copy the code below into your script in RStudio. Start with the line `install.packages` and end with the line `color = 'random-dark')`.

```{r wordcloud, eval=F}
install.packages(c("wordcloud2", "dplyr"))
library(wordcloud2)
library(dplyr)

#---- Class names ----# 
class <- c("Steve"    = 8, 
           "Mike"     = 9, 
           "Eric"     = 8, 
           "Hannah"   = 9, 
           "Jon"      = 8, 
           "Mary"     = 9, 
           "Min"      = 9, 
           "Aida"     = 9,
           "Matthias" = 8,
           "Gao"      = 9,
           "Ben"      = 9,
           "Eva"      = 9,
           "James"    = 10,
           "Kitty"    = 11,
           "Zeb"      = 9,
           #---- Fun names ----#
           "R"        = 26, 
           "2019"     = 20,
           "MPCA"     = 16,
           "Porgs!"    = 84,
           "Endor"     = 10,
           "Jakku"     = 10,
           "BB8"       = 12,
           "Rey"       = 8,
           "Derek"     = 8, 
           "Kristie"   = 8, 
           "Barbara"   = 8, 
           "Dorian"    = 8)

# Add 20 Star Wars names as small text, size = 4
class <- c(class, rep(4, 20))

names(class)[(length(class) - 19):length(class)] <- sample_n(starwars, 20)$name      

# Plot the Word Cloud with the "random-dark" color theme
wordcloud2(data.frame(word = names(class), freq = class), 
           size  = 1, 
           color = 'random-dark')

```

3. In R Studio click on __File > New File > R Script__. You will see a code editor window open. 

![](images/new_script_file.png){style="width: 65%; margin-bottom: 18px;"}

4. Paste the copied code into the upper left hand window. This is your code editor.  
5. Highlight all of the code and hit `CTRL + ENTER`.
6. You should see a Word Cloud pop up in the lower right of RStudio.
7. Now try increasing the number next to your name.  
8. Run the code again.
    - You may need to increase the size of the `Viewer` window shown below to make enough room for your name to appear. You can also click the `Zoom` icon to create a bigger word cloud.
9. Make your name even __BIGGER!__

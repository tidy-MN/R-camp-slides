Let's introduce ourselves and the data we love. Chat with your __partner__ and get to know some things about them.


__Chit-chat ideas__  

- Your name or Star Wars alias 
- Types of data you have
    - Who you share it with
- Something you want to get from the workshop
- The funniest part of your data
- The most repetitive part? __Hint:__ _Maybe this is something you can automate with R_

- How to modify the gridlines behind your chart?
    - Try the different themes at the end of this lesson: `+ theme_light()` or `+ theme_bw()`
    - Or modify the color and size with `+ theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.5))`
- How do you set the x and y scale manually?
    - Here is an example with a scatter plot: `ggplot() + geom_point() + xlim(beginning, end) + ylim(beginning, end)`
    - __Warning:__ Values above or below the limits you set will not be shown. This is another great way to lie with data. 
- How do you get rid of the legend if you don't need it?
    - `geom_point(aes(color = county), guide = FALSE)`
    - The [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/) shows a number of ways to hide legends.
- I only like dashed lines. How do you change the linetype to a _dashed_ line? 
    - `geom_line(aes(color = facility_name), linetype = "dashed")`
    - You can also try `"dotted"` and `"dotdash"`, or even`"twodash"`
  
- How many colors are there in R? How does R know `hotpink` is a color?
    - There is an [R color cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)  
    - As well as a list of [R color names](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names/)
    - `library(viridis)` provides some great default color palettes for charts and maps.
    - This [Color web tool](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) has palette ideas and color codes you can use in your plots

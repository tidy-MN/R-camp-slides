<b> _dplyr_ </b> is the go-to tool for exploring, re-arranging, and summarizing data.  

We could install it the usual way, but there is GOOD NEWS! All of our favorite packages are bundled together into a super package called **`tidyverse`**. Installing and loading the *tidyverse* package will load the previous `readr` and `ggplot2` packages we introduced earlier, as well as `dplyr` and other great packages.

Here is the complete list of packages in the `tidyverse`

> - **`readr`**
> - **`ggplot2`**
> - **`dplyr`**
> - `tidyr`
> - `lubridate`
> - `stringr`
> - `forcats`
> - `purrr`
> - `tibble`

<br>

Use `install.packages("tidverse")` to add the _tidyverse_ to your library.  

<div style="clear: both; margin-top: 22px;"></div>

Then try loading the package from your library to test if it was installed.
```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

<br>

> We can now use **ALL** the functions included in any of the *tidyverse* packages, including `dplyr`.

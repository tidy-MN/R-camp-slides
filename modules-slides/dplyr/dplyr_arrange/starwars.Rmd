```{r arrange-price, warning = F}
# Arrange scrap items by price
scrap <- arrange(scrap, price_per_pound)

# View the top 6 rows
head(scrap)
```

## Put the BIG things first  {-}

To arrange a column in descending order with the biggest numbers on top, we use `desc(...)` around the column name.

```{r desc-arrange, warning=F}
# Put most expensive items on top
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

# View the top 8 rows
head(scrap, 8)
```

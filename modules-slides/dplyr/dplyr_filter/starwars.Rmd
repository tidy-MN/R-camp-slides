Let's use it to look at the rows in the data that have an item listed as `"Total"`.

```{r filter12, eval=T}
filter(scrap, item == "Total")
```

<div class="note">
### Note {-}

#### `==` vs. `=` {-}

We use a `==` (double equals sign) for comparing values. A `==` makes the comparison "is it equal to?" and returns a True or False answer. So the code above returns only the rows where the condition `origin == "All"` is TRUE.

A single equals sign `=` is used within functions to set options, for example `read_csv(file = "scrap.csv")`. 

It's not a big deal if you mix them up the first time. R is often helpful and will let you know which one is needed.

## Comparing values {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

We use a variety of comparisons when processing data. Sometimes we only want concentrations above a certain level, or days below a given temperature, or sites that have missing observations. 

We use the __Menu__ of comparisons below to find the data we want.

<div class="pinkcode">

<h3 style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: -4px;"> Menu of comparisons </h3>

| Symbol | Comparison               |
|:-------|:-------------------------|
| `>`    | greater than             |
| `>=`   | greater than or equal to |
| `<`    | less than                |
| `<=`   | less than or equal to    |
| `==`   | equal to                 |
| `!=`   | NOT equal to             |
| `%in%` | value is in a list: `X %in% c(1,3,7)` |
| `is.na(...)`  | is the value missing? |
| `str_detect(col_name, "word")`  | "word" appears in text? |

Try comparing some things in the console to see if you get what you'd expect. R doesn't always think like we do.

```{r, eval=F}
4 != 5

4 == 4

4 < 3

4 > c(1, 3, 5)

5 == c(1, 3, 5)

5 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 == NA
```
</div>


## Dropping rows {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Let's look at the data without the _Total_ category. Look in the comparison table above to find the `NOT` operator. We're going to filter the data to keep only the items that are `NOT equal` to "Total".

```{r filter-all}
scrap <- filter(scrap, item != "Total")
```

We can arrange the data in ascending order by `item` to confirm the "All" category is gone.

```{r filter-arrange, message=F, warning=F}
# Arrange data
scrap <- arrange(scrap, item)

head(scrap)
```

<br>

<div class="well">
Now let's take another look at that bar chart.

```{r ggplot-noAll}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount)) + geom_col()
``` 


### Great work! {-}

</div>


## Multiple filters {-} 
<hr class="hrlvl2">

We can add multiple comparisons to `filter()` to further restrict the data we pull from a larger data set. Only the records that pass the conditions of all the comparisons will be pulled into the new data frame. 

The code below filters the data to only scrap records with an origin of `Outskirts` __AND__ a destination of `Niima Outpost`.

```{r filter-multi, eval=F}
outskirts_to_niima <- filter(scrap, 
                             origin        == "Outskirts", 
                             destination   == "Niima Outpost")
```

<br>

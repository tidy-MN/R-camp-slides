
### Units update {-}

Let's use `ifelse` to update the units column to all be written as "Tons".

```{r ifelse, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Get the data
scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")

# Convert the TONS in all capital letters to title case "Tons"
# On Day 1 we did this using tolower()

scrap <- scrap %>% 
         mutate(units = ifelse(units == "TONS", 
                               "Tons", 
                               units))
```

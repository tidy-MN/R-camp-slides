
You can assign values to objects (variables) using the .teal[left arrow]. 

- It looks like this: `<- `  
- It's typed with a less-than sign `<` followed by a hyphen `-`  
- Itâ€™s more officially known as the *assignment operator*

### Let's name our baking bot! {-}

Copy the code below to your R script to create a bot called `whisky`.

### Assignment operator {-}
```{r names, eval=F}
# Create an empty text object
bot <- ""

# See what is in the object
bot 

# Assign it a new value
bot <- "Whisker"

bot

```

> To run a line of code in your script, put the cursor anywhere on that line and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ENTER</kbd>.


Now our baking bot needs a friend. Let's create a `bot2`. Go ahead and name it anything you like. 
```{r names2, eval=F}
bot_friend <- "Baker-waker"

bot_friend
```


__Break some things__
```{r, eval=F}
# Try this:
bot3 <- Chewie
```

### Error! {-}

Generally, when you write a word without quotes, R will look for an object with that name in your Environment (see the area in the top-right). It will then look for a function with that name. If it doesn't find either, it will let you know that it couldn't find one. Try again but add quotation marks around `"Chewie"`.

<p style="color: blue;"> Blue shows the exact code you ran. </p>

__Copy objects__
```{r duplicate, eval=F}
# To copy an object, assign it to a new name
bot <- wookie


# Or overwrite an object with new "text"
wookie <- "Tarfful"
  
wookie


# Wookie2 stays the same
wookie2  
```


__Numbers!__
```{r nums, eval=F}
wookie_salary <- 500

# Let's give Chewbacca a big raise $$$
wookie_salary <- 500 * 2

# Print new salary 
wookie_salary

# We can also use the object to multiply
wookie_salary * 2

# To save the change we assign it back to itself
wookie_salary <- wookie_salary * 2
```


## Drop and remove data {-}

You can drop objects with the remove function `rm() `. Try it out on some of your wookies.

```{r, eval=F}
# Delete objects to clean-up your Environment
rm(bot2)

rm(bot3)
```

How can we get the `wookie` object back?

_Hint: You are allowed to re-run your code. You can even click the **Run** button at the top to re-run ALL of your script._

</div>

<br>


<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue"> **Deleting things is okay** **>** </summary>
<div class="note" style="margin-top: 0;">
<p>
Don't worry about deleting data or objects in R. You can always recreate them! When R loads your data it copies the contents and then cuts off any connection to the original data. So your original data remain safe and won't suffer any accidental changes. 

By saving your analysis in an R script you can always re-run the code to get any of your results back. It's common and good practice to **re-run** your entire R script during your analysis.

## What's a good name? {-}

Everything has a name in R and you can name things almost anything you like, even `TOP_SECRET_SHHHH...` or `data_face_99`.

But there are a _few_ restrictions. R doesn't like names to include spaces or special characters found in math equations, like `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`, `/`, `=`, `!`, or `)`. 

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Try running some of these examples. Find new ways to create errors. Half of learning R is finding what doesn't work.

```{r, eval=F}
# What happens when you add these to your R script?
n wookies <- 5

n*wookies <- 5

n_wookies <- 5

n.wookies <- 5

wookies! <- "Everyone"
```


#### Names with numbers {-}
```{r, eval=F}
# Names cannot begin with a number
1st_wookie <- "Chewbacca"

88b <- "droid"

# But they can contain numbers
wookie1 <- "Chewbacca"

bb8 <- "droid"

# What if you have 10,000 wookies?
n_wookies <- 10,000  # Error

n_wookies <- 10000
```

<br> 

- Try to create a **new** error or warning you haven't seen yet.

</div>


## Collect multiple items {-}

We can put multiple values inside `c()` to make a vector of items. It's like a chain of items, where each additional item is connected by a comma. The `c` stands for _concatenate_ or to _collect_.
  
Let's use `c()` to create a few vectors of names.

```{r vectors}
# Create a character vector and name it starwars_characters
starwars_characters <- c("Luke", "Leia", "Han Solo")

# Print starwars_characters
starwars_characters

# Create a numeric vector and name it starwars_ages
starwars_ages  <- c(19,19,25)

# Print the ages to the console
starwars_ages
```

<br>

<div class="note">
<h3> Note </h3>

Take a look at the new additions to your _Environment_ pane located on the top right. 

![](../images/environment_explore.png){style="width: 75%; margin-bottom: 14px;"}

This window shows all of the objects we've created so far and the types of data they contain. It's a great first look to see if our script ran successfully. You can click the __`broom`__ icon to sweep everything out and start with a clean slate.

## Make a table {-}

![](../images/vector_to_dataframe.png){width="510" style="margin-left: 100px;"}

<br>

A table in R is known as a __data frame__. We can think of it as a group of columns, where each column is made from a vector. Data frames in R have columns of data that are all the same length. 

Let's make a data frame with two columns to hold the character names and their ages.
```{r table}

# Create table with 2 columns: characters & ages
starwars_df <- data.frame(characters = starwars_characters,
                          ages       = starwars_ages)

# Print the starwars_df data frame to the console
starwars_df

```

<br>

source("../../insert_tabs.R")

tabs <- c("Add a column", "Show hint", "Show code")

content <- c(Exercise = '<h4> Add a __3rd__ column that lists their `fathers` names: </h4>

- `c("Darth", "Darth", "Unknown") ` 

<br>',

show_hint = 'code_start

starwars_df <- data.frame(characters  = starwars_characters, 
                          ages        = starwars_ages, 
                          fathers     = __________________)
code_end',

show_code = 'code_start

starwars_df <- data.frame(characters  = starwars_characters, 
                          ages        = starwars_ages, 
                          fathers     = c("Darth", "Darth", "Unknown"))
code_end')

tab_html <- add_tabs(tabs, content)

cat(paste0(tab_html, collapse = "\n"))
```
</div>


<br>

### Show all values in `$column_name`  {-}

Use the `$` sign after the name of your table to see the values in one of your columns.

```{r columns}
# View the "ages" column in starwars_df
starwars_df$ages
```


### Notes and comments {-}

The italic and orange lines in the scripts above are called comments. You can add notes to your scripts with the `#` to make it easier for others and yourself to understand what is happening and why.

Every line that starts with a `#` is ignored and won't be run as R code. 
You can also use comments to add warnings or instructions for others using your code.

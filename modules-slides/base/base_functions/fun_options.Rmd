### Function options {-}

Functions have options —also called arguments— that change how they behave. You can set these optins using _arguments_. Let's look at a few of the arguments for the function `read_csv()`.

<br><br>

<h3> Skip a row </h3>

Sometimes you may want to ignore the first row in your data file, especially an EPA file that includes a disclaimer on the first row. Yes EPA, we're looking at you. Please stop.

Let's open the help window with `?read_csv` and try to find an argument that can help us. 

```{r, eval=F}
?read_csv
```

There's a lot of them! But the `skip` argument looks like it could be helpful. Take a look at the description near the bottom. The default is `skip = 0`, which reads every line, but we can skip the first line by writing `skip = 1`. Let's try.

```{r, eval=F}
read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv", 
         skip = 1)
```


<h3> Limit the number of rows </h3>

Some types of data have last rows that show the _total_ or report "END OF DATA". In these cases we may want `read_csv` to ignore the last row of data, or for large data sets we may only want to pull in a 100 lines of data to see what you're working with. 

Let's look through the help window to find an argument that can help us. Type `?read_csv` and scroll down.

The `n_max` argument looks like it could be helpful. The default is `n_max = Inf`, which means it will read every line, but we can limit the lines we read to only one hundred by using `n_max = 100`.

```{r, eval=F}
# Read in 100 rows
small_data <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv", 
                       skip = 1, 
                       n_max = 100)

# Remove the data
rm(small_data)

```

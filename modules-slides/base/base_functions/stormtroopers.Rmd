<p>
<div class="well" style="background-color: lightblue; margin-top: -13px;">
_Functions_ perform steps based on inputs called _arguments_ and usually return an output object. There are _functions_ in R that are really complex but most boil down to the same general setup:

```{r, eval=F}
new_output <- function(argument_input1, argument_input2)
```

You can make your own functions in R and name them almost anything you like, even `my_amazing_starwars_function()`.

<br>

You can think of a _function_ like a plan for making Clone Troopers.

<br>

```{r, eval=F} 
create_clones(host       = "Jango Fett", 
              n_troopers = 2000)
```

<br>

The _function_ above creates Clone Troopers based on two _arguments_: the `host` and `n_troopers`. When we have more than one _argument_, we use a comma to separate them. With some luck, the function will successfully return a new object - a group of 2,000 Clone Troopers.

__The `sum()` function__

We can use the `sum()` function to find the sum age of our Star Wars characters.

```{r}
starwars_ages  <- c(19,19,25)

# Call the sum function with starwars_ages as input
ages_sum <- sum(starwars_ages) # Assigns the output to starwars_ages_sum

# Print the starwars_ages_sum value to the console
ages_sum

```

<br>

The `sum()` function takes the _starwars_ages_ vector as input, performs a calculation, and returns a number. Note that we assigned the output to the name `ages_sum`. 

If we don't assign the output it will be printed to the console and not saved.

```{r}
# Alternative without assigning output
sum(starwars_ages) 
```

<br>

<div class="note">
### Note {-}
The original `starwars_ages` vector has not changed. Each function has its own "environment" and its calculations happen inside a bubble. In general, what happens inside a function won't change your objects outside of the function.

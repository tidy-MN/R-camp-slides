### CHALLENGE

Let's get back Jakku. BB8 is detecting an incoming message, but he needs your help tracking down where it is coming from. If you can find the planet it's being sent from, BB8 should be able to decode it for Rey. Use the message logs to work your way backwards through the relay stations and pinpoint the message's origin planet.

Use this file to start your search.
```{r, eval = F}

# Download the current relay station logs
source("messages/relays.R")

tibble(id = "44A-P2", origin = "relays-endor-station2", message = paste0(sample(0:9, 44, replace = T), collapse = "-"))

# Open the received message information
df <- read_csv("messages/received_44A-P2.csv")
```

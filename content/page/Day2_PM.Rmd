Plot a histogram of the character heights.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Height distribution
ggplot(star_df, aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(fill = "hotpink")
```

<br>

<div class="note">

- Try changing the fill color to __"<span style="color: #FD6A02;">darkorange</span>"__.

- Try making a histogram of the column `mass`.

</div>

<br>

Plot comparisons between height and mass with `geom_point(...)`.
```{r, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Height vs. Mass scatterplot
ggplot(star_df, aes(y = mass, x = height)) +
   geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 5)
```
<br>

Who's who? Let's add some labels to the points.
```{r, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Add labels
ggplot(star_df, aes(y = mass, x = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 5) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = name))


# Use a log scale for Mass on the y-axis
ggplot(star_df, aes(y = mass, x = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 5) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = name)) +
  scale_y_log10()

```

<br>

Let's drop the "Hutt" species before plotting.
```{r, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Without the Hutt
ggplot(filter(star_df, species != "Hutt"), aes(y = mass, x = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 5) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = name, color = species))

```

<br>

We can add `facet_wrap` to make a chart for each species.
```{r, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
# Split out by species
ggplot(star_df, aes(x = mass, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 3) +
  facet_wrap("species") +
  guides(color = "none")
```

### Teaser {-}

Analysts often get asked questions:

- What's the highest number? 
- What's the lowest number? 
- What was the average tons of scrap from Cratertown last year? 
- Which town's scrap was worth the most credits?

</div>


<br>


## Plots of garbage {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">


Try making a scatterplot of any two columns with `geom_point()`.

_Hint: Numeric variables will be more informative._

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = __column1__, y = __column2__)) + 
    geom_point()
```



## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's use color to show the origins of the scrap
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, color = origin)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>

This is a **A LOT** of detail. Let's make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) + geom_col()
```


>
> It's still tricky to compare sales by origin. Let's change the position of the columns. 
>


```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```



# More Plots
<hr>

## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's use color to show the destinations of the scrap.

```{r, eval=T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, color = destination)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>


<div class="yoda">
###  Yoda says {-}

<img src="../images/yoda_baby_sq.png" class="yoda-img">

One way to experiment with colors is to add the layers `+ scale_fill_brewer()` or `+ scale_color_brewer()` to your plot. These link to [**colorBrewer**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html) palettes to give you accessible color themes.
</div>


## Bar charts {-}

This is way too much detail. Let's simplify by making a bar chart that shows the total sales. Note that we use `fill=` inside `aes()` instead of `color=`. If we use color, we get a colorful outline and gray bars.


```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col()
```

<br>

Let's change the position of the bars to make it easier to compare sales by destination for each origin? Remember, you can use `help(geom_col)` to learn about the different options for that plot. Feel free to do the same with other `geom_`'s as well.


```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```


## Facet wrap {-}

Does the chart feel crowded to you? Let's use the `facet wrap` function to put each origin on a separate chart.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination")
```


## Labels {-}

We can add lables to the chart by adding the `labs()` layer. Let's give our chart from above a title.

__Titles and labels__
```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  labs(title    = "Scrap sales by origin and destination",
       subtitle = "Planet Jakku",
       x        = "Origin", 
       y        = "Total sales")
```

<br>


## Add lines {-}

> More layers! Let's say we were advised to avoid sales that were over _50 Billion_ credits. Let's add that as a horizontal line to our chart. For that, we use `geom_hline()`.

__Reference lines__
```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  labs(title    = "Scrap sales by origin and destination",
       subtitle = "Planet Jakku",
       x        = "Origin", 
       y        = "Total sales") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5E+10, color = "black", size = 1)
```



## Drop `2.2e+06` scientific notation {-}

Want to get rid of that ugly scientific notation? We can use `options(scipen = 999)`. Note that this is a general setting in R. Once you use `options(scipen = 999)` in your current session, you don't have to use it again. _(Like loading a package, you only need to run the line once when you start a new R session)._

<br>

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
options(scipen = 999)

ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Let's say we don't like printing so many zeros and want the labels to be in __Millions__ of credits. Any ideas on how to make that happen?
</div>


## Themes {-}

You may not like the appearance of these plots. `ggplot2` uses `theme` functions to change the appearance of a plot. View the list of themes [here](#theme-tbl).

Try some.

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_dark()
```


<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Be bold and make a __boxplot__. We've covered how to do a scatterplot with `geom_point` and a bar chart with `geom_col`, but how would you make a boxplot showing the prices at each destination? Feel free to experiment with `color` ,`facet_wrap`, `theme`, and `labs`.

When you add more layers to your plot using `+`, remember to place it at the end of each line.

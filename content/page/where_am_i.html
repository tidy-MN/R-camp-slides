<p>You are in your <strong>working directory</strong> (folder).</p>
<p>When you open a new R project in RStudio your starting working directory is your project folder. Your project folder is like your <strong>home</strong> folder, and is the default location R will look for data files unless told otherwise.</p>
<p>To load a file called <code>new_data.csv</code> stored directly in your project folder, you only need to enter its name as the file path:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;new_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>What if the data is in a different folder?</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to call a different country? When you dial a number, your phone will generally assume the default Country Code is the country that you’re standing in when you dial a number. But when you want to call another country, like Canada, you have to add the Country Code to the front of the number you’re dialing.</p>
<p>Similarly, to access files outside of your home directory you will need to tell R to go look in another folder.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Say you have a folder <code>Endor</code> sitting in your project folder, and inside it there’s a file called <code>Ewok_data.csv</code>. To read the file into R you would write:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Endor/Ewok_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The slash used for file paths in R is a forward leaning slash (<code>/</code>), and is the opposite of the slash commonly seen in folder locations on <em>Windows</em> computers. If you get an <strong>ERROR</strong> when trying to load a file, remember to check your slashes.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>If a file is completely outside of your project, you’ll want to include the file’s entire file path on your computer. This is also known as an <em>absolute path</em>. An absolute path usually begins with the letter of the computer drive, such as <code>C:/</code> or <code>X:/</code>. Loading a file called <code>secret_data.csv</code> directly from your Desktop would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;C:/Users/me/Desktop/secret_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br></p>

<p>Much better, simple file paths are.</p>
<p>File paths with your user name in them don’t share well with others and may break if the data is moved. It’s best to store data in your project folder as much as possible to avoid using absolute paths.</p>

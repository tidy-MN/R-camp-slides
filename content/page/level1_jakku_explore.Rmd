> Remember what you should do first when you start your R session? 
First we load the packages we will need.

<br>
```{r, eval=T}
#Load packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

> Start by reading in the data.
> It is a clean version of the scrap data we've been using.

> _Notice_ that we are including comments in the R script so that your future self can follow along and see what you did.

### Read in data {-}
```{r, eval=T}
clean_scrap <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku_clean.csv")

head(clean_scrap)
```

<br>

> Did it load successfully?
> Look in your environment.
> You should see "clean_scrap".
> There should be 6 variables and 573 rows.

<br>

> Take a couple of minutes to get an overview of the data. 
> Open and look at your data in at least two ways.

<br>

> 1. Click on the data name in the environment to open the window.
>
> 2. Use glimpse() to look at your data.

_*Curious how he knows about quantiles, maybe someone told him to use this to test our abilities._

<summary class = "btn_code_green"> **Hint: ** </summary>
<p>

You will need the pipe `%>%`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `quantile()`, and `n()`.

# Install `R`

The R language and its tools are built by people from around the world. They help you perform data analysis in an easy to follow step-by-step fashion, much like a recipe for cookies. And once you find your favorite recipe, you can use it over again on new data or even share it with your collaborators.

# Install `RStudio` 
<hr>

<br>

__RStudio__ is the handy user interface we use to write R scripts and keep our projects organized. It isn't required to use R, but it makes things a whole lot easier.

<br><br>


__Install RStudio__  

<div class="well" style="margin-top: 4px;">
1. Open the Software Center
2. Search for RStudio
3. Choose the blue R bubble
4. Click `[ Install ]`

# Install `R packages`
<hr>

R comes installed with many built-in functions and tools to help do your work. On top of this foundation, what is often referred to as _base R_, contributors from around the world have created tools that make R easier and accomplish more with your data. These add-ons are called `packages`, and are made available to everyone to download for free. Below are a few examples, grouped into general categories. 


__Packages used in this training__ 

>  Load data

`readr`     Load data from text files: tab, comma, and other delimited files   
`readxl`    Load data from Excel   
`janitor`   Clean and simplify column names   
`DBI`       Load data from databases    
`haven`     Load SAS, SPSS, and Stata files    
`sf`        Load data from GIS shapefiles     

<br>

>  Manipulate data

`dplyr`        Essential shortcuts to subset, summarize, rearrange, and join data sets.  
`tidyr`        Reshape tables and unpack multiple inputs stored in single cell.  
`stringr`      Tools to edit and clean text and character strings.  
`lubridate`    Tools to format dates and perform calculations based on time.  

<br>

>  Charts and visuals

`ggplot2`      Essential package for plots and charts.  

<br>

> Maps 

`leaflet`      Display spatial data and make interactive maps.  
`sf`           Simple features for GIS and maps, a spatial format using data frames to perform spatial analysis.  

<br>

> General

`remotes`    Install packages directly from online sources like GitHub and Gitlab.  

<br>

<div class="note">

### Add R packages

To use a _package_ you first need to install it -- much like a free App for your phone. To get a jump start on the workshop, you can copy the text below and paste it into the RStudio console. The console is found on the left-side of the screen when you open RStudio. 


```{r, eval=F}
new_packages <- c("readr", "readxl", "dplyr", "stringr", "tidyr",
                  "ggplot2", "lubridate", "janitor", "curl")

install.packages(new_packages)
```


![](../../images/install_screen.png){style="margin-top: 4px; width: 75%;"}

<br>

Then press `ENTER` to begin the installation. If all goes well, you should start to see some messages appear similar to this, which provide information on the installation progress.

![](../../images/install_msg.png){width="75%"}

<br>

Did it work? Try running the code below to load the `readr` package from your library and see if it is installed.
```{r, eval=F}
library(readr)
```

There are two places to update R packages in RStudio.

<br>

#### 1. In the `Files and Plots` area in the bottom right, under the `Packages` tab:

Click the green __Update__ button next to Install.

<br>

#### 2. In the `Tools` tab above at the top above the Code Editor:

Choose the 2nd option -> _"Check for Package Updates..."_

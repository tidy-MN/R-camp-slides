# Finn needs us! {-}

Turn this ship around BB8, Finn needs us back on Jakku. We're going to have to get better at our roll call procedure. Here we come Finn.  __Blast off!__

Okay, so we're back on this ol' dust bucket planet. Let's try not to forget anyone this time. Data droid, let me know if anyone goes missing.

# `group_by()` category
<hr>

`group_by()` gives us the power to calculate separate results for each category in the data. This could be the average concentration at each of your monitoring sites, or the total emissions of a pollutant from each facility or stack.

```{r group-by, child='../../static/modules/dplyr/dplyr_groupby/groupby_nopipe.Rmd'}

## Save results {-}

A sickness is spreading throughout the galaxy. To slow its spread should we restrict travel to some planets? Or is it too late?
   
   
Follow the steps below to collect the current disease records and summarize cases by planet. To do so, you'll need to join the disease records to a separate table with the planet information. 
  

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)

# Generate the disease records
people <- starwars

n_rows <- 333

records <- tibble(date = sample(seq.Date(as.Date("2018-01-01"), as.Date("2023-01-01"), 1), n_rows, replace = T),
                  caseid = sample(111111:999999, n_rows),
                  name = people %>% filter(!is.na(homeworld)) %>% .$name %>% sample(33) %>% sample(n_rows-1, replace = T) %>% c(., "Rey"),
                  status = sample(1:3, n_rows, replace = T))

joined <- left_join(records, people)

joined <- group_by(joined, homeworld)

a <- summarize(joined, total = n()) %>% arrange(-total)

writexl::write_xlsx(records, "data/disease_records.xlsx")
write_csv(records, "data/disease_records.csv")
```
  
### Create a new project {-}

Go to `File` > `New Project...` > `New Directory` > `New Project`

- Name the project `sickness`


## Get the disease data {-}
  
<a href="https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/disease_records.xlsx"><button class="button-dl" download="disease_records.xlsx">
Download (XLSX) &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-download"></i>
</button></a>  
  
Click the button above to download the Excel file *disease_records.xlsx*    

- Save the file to your project folder 

If the file was automatically downloaded to your *Downloads* folder, move or copy the file to your project folder. 
  
  
### Load the data {-}

> Create a new R script and save it as *disease_report.R*

To load the data, use `read_xlsx()` from the `readxl` library to load the disease data into R. Add the code below to your R script and ensure the file name matches the file added to your project folder.

```{r, eval=F}
library(readxl)

records <- read_xlsx("disease_records.xlsx")
```


<details>
<summary class="btn_code_blue">**Plan B** - Read the data from CSV</summary>

```{r, eval=F}
library(readr)

records <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/disease_records.csv")
```

</details>


### Explore {-}

Use `glimpse()` to view a summary of the data columns.


## Planet data {-}

To find the planets these records are associated with, we will need to join the records data to the `starwars` data set in the package `dplyr`.  

To load the planet data, add the following to your R script:
  
```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)

people <- starwars
```


### Explore {-}

> What is the number of distinct values in the `homeworld` column of the *people* data set?

- Use `n_distinct()` to count the number of 'homeworld' planets.

```{r, eval=F}
summarize(people, n_planets = n_distinct( _______ ))
```


> What are they? Print the unique values of the `homeworld` column in the *people* data set:

- Use `distinct()` to show the unique values of `homeworld` column.

```{r, eval=F}
distinct(people, ________ )
```

> Is one of the homeworlds `NA`? What does the 'NA' mean here?

<br>

### Join the homeworld planets to disease records {-}

Complete the script below to join the two data sets. 

1. In the 1st blank, with the name of the data you want to join to `records`.  
2. In the 2nd blank, put the column name found in both data sets that you want to join **by** in quotes `""`. This is the column that both tables have in common.  

> You can run `names(records)` to view the column names in the dataframe.


```{r, eval=F}
joined <- left_join(records, _______ , 
                    by = "______" )
```


### Summarize the records by homeworld {-}

Use `group_by()` to group the records by the planet column:`homeworld`

```{r, eval=F}
joined <- group_by(joined, homeworld) 
```

<br>

Now you can use the `n()` function to find the number of records by `homeworld`.

```{r, eval=F}
planet_totals <- summarize(joined, cases = _______ )
```


### Restricted travel? {-}

> Which planet has the most cases?

Use `arrange()` and `desc()` to sort the results by the `cases` column. 

```{r, eval=F}
planet_totals <- arrange(planet_totals, ________ )
```

<br>

> How many planets are off limits?

The health liaison has recommended cutting off travel to any planet with more than 20 cases.

Use `filter()` to keep only the planets in the data with more than 20 in the `cases` column.

```{r, eval=F}
off_limits <- filter(planet_totals, ________ )
```

<br>

### Save {-}

1. Use `write_csv()` to save the planet list as **"restricted_planets.csv"**.  
1. Save your R script.  
1. Clap 3 times for your great work.  
1. When ready, return to your `jakku` project.

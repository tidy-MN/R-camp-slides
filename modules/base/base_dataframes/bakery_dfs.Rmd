## Let's make a tidy table with our baking bots. {-}

<img src="../images/vector_to_dataframe.png" width="510" style="margin-left: 100px;">


<br>

A table in R is known as a __data frame__. We can think of it as a group of columns, where each column is a vector. Data frames in R have columns of data that are all the same length.

Let's make a data frame that has two columns to hold the bot names and their ages.

```{r}
# Character vector of baking_bot names
baking_bots <- c("Whiskers", "Baker-waker", "BB-8")

# Numeric vector of bot ages
bot_ages <- c(1, 2, NA)
```

<br>


```{r table}
# Create table with 2 columns: name and age
bots <- data.frame(name = baking_bots,
                   age  = bot_ages)

# Print the data frame to the console
bots
```

<br>

<div class="quiz">

### <i class="fa-solid fa-cookie-bite" style="color: gray;"></i> Taste test {-}

```{r exer-tabs, results='asis', echo=F}
source("../../insert_tabs.R")

tabs <- c("Add a column", "Show hint", "Show code")

content <- c(Exercise = '<h4> Add a __3rd__ column that lists if the bot `has_wheels`: </h4>

- ` c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) `

<br>',

show_hint = 'code_start

bots <- data.frame(name       = baking_bots,
                   age        = bot_ages,
                   has_wheels = __________________ )
code_end',

show_code = 'code_start

bots <- data.frame(name       = baking_bots,
                   age        = bot_ages,
                   has_wheels = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) )
code_end')

tab_html <- add_tabs(tabs, content)

cat(paste0(tab_html, collapse = "\n"))
```
</div>


<br>

### Show all values in `$column_name` {-} 

Use the `$` sign after the name of your table to see the values in one of your columns.

```{r columns}
# View the "name" column in bots
bots$name

# Find the max age value
max(bots$age)

# Find the max age value, ignore NA (missing) values
max(bots$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

<br>
 
### Matrix syntax: [`row`, `column`]  {-}

Use matrix syntax to access any value in the table.

```{r columns-rows}
# Row 3, Column 1 (the third value in the 'name' column)
bots[3, 1]

# You can also view a specific column's values with the column name
bots[ , "age"]

```


## Notes and comments {-}

The italic and orange lines in the scripts above are called comments. You can add notes to your scripts with the `#` to make it easier for others and yourself to understand what is happening and why.

Every line that starts with a `#` is ignored and won't be run as R code.


## Save a table

We are ready to save our wonderful little table. We will save the data to a file with the handy function `write_csv()`. The code below saves the table to a __CSV__ _(comma-separated values)_ file named *"bot_data.csv"*.


```{r write-bots, eval=F}
# Save dataframe to a CSV file in our project folder
write_csv(bots, file = "bot_data.csv")
```

> Did you get the error _could not find function "write_csv"_?
>
> Jump back to the top of your script and run the line `library(tidyverse)`.

<br>

> **Where did the file get saved?**
> 
> The file is saved into our project folder by default. You can view it in the `[Files]` pane to the right of the console. Click the file name and select **View File**. You will see a tab open with contents similar to below.

<br>

__bot_data.csv__
```{r, eval=F}
name,age
Whiskers,1
Baker-waker,2
BB-8,NA
```


## CSVs {-}

A __CSV__ is a simple text file that can be opened in R and most other data tools, including Excel. It looks squished together as plain text, but that's okay! When opened in R, the text becomes a familiar looking table with columns and rows.
